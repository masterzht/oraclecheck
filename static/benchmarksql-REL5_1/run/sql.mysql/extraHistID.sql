-- Extra Schema objects/definitions for history.hist_id in Oracle
-- ----

-- ----
--	This is an extra column not present in the TPC-C
--	specs. It is useful for replication systems like
--	Bucardo and Slony-I, which like to have a primary
--	key on a table. It is an auto-increment or serial
--	column type. The definition below is compatible
--	with Oracle 11g, using the sequence in a trigger.
-- ----
-- Adjust the sequence above the current max(hist_id)
